Cloud Classification & Rainfall Prediction with Deep Learning
This project introduces a cutting-edge deep learning framework using MobileNetV2 and Xception CNNs to automate cloud type classification and rainfall prediction (No to Low, Low to Medium, Medium to High). Enhanced by preprocessing, data augmentation, and a two-phase transfer learning approach, it overcomes the limitations of traditional meteorological methodsâ€”subjectivity, scalability, and inefficiency. Integrated into a Flask web app, it offers real-time, high-confidence predictions with a user-friendly interface. Outperforming conventional techniques in accuracy and speed, this lightweight, scalable solution bridges meteorology and AI, empowering agriculture, aviation, disaster management, and environmental monitoring with precise, efficient weather insights.
